Some teams qualified for the 2014 World Cup. The score of the teams were stored in an array in sorted order and array index is the represents the team. Index 0 represents the Team 1; index 1 represents the Team 2 and so on.  If a score is given, then should find out which team got that score with a O(log(n)) time.  

 Since Ram wanted to solve this puzzle with binary search and he decided to write binary search himself.  But he cannot remember the logic of binary search .  Help Ram to write the program.

 Note:

Create the main() inside the class 'BinarySearch'

Function signature : public static int binarySearch(int[] ar,int size,int key)



Input and Output Format:

Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.

Sample Input and Output 1:

Enter the number of Teams:

5

Enter the score:

12

16

23

45
