/*
Read the question carefully and follow the input and output format.

Given the cubic capacity(CC) of a bike. Write a program to print the mileage/liter for the given Cubic Capacity(CC). The mileage will be calculated as follows:


 
If CC is between 100 and 125, mileage is 75

if CC is between 126 and 135, mileage is 70

if CC is between 136 and 150, mileage is 60

if CC is between 151 and 200, mileage is 50

if CC is between 201 and 220 mileage is 35
First line of input consists of an integer that corresponds to CC of a bike.output consist of an integer which is the mileage.

Print “Number too large” when the given input CC is greater than 220.

Print “Number too small” when the given input CC is less than 100.

Sample input 1:

1

Sample output 1:

Number too small

Sample input 2:

160

Sample output 2:

50
